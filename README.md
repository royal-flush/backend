# JobsTT Backend (Node.js Server)

## About
This repo contains the code for a Node.js backend to facilitate the calls from the JobsTT frontend. This backend returns data from and enters data into a database.

## Documentation
The full documentation for this backend detailing each of the api calls can be found [here in this Postman link](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4777384/S1TVXdcB).

## Getting Started
This backend was made with Node.js and Express along with a few more important dependencies. To get started, you will need to install all necessary dependencies.

## Installing
To install, run the following command in the project directory
```
yarn
```

## Running
To run the backend, run the following command
```
node index.js
```
or
```
nodemon index.js
```
This runs the node server using [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) (Node Monitor) which allows the node server to listen for changes while coding then restarts the server when changes are saved.
